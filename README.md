### Project name: Traffic monitoring with distributed acoustic sensing

The following repository contains the work done by team Fotech during the month of August in the Summer 2020 PIMS Math^Industry Workshop. The main goals addressed in this repository are outlined by Matt McDonald in the abstract below, and the members of teach Fotech are Emily Korfanty, Jaeun Park, Jane Zhang, Sarah Nataj, Boya Peng, and Brian Chan. Our industrial advisor for this project is Matt McDonald and our academic advisor for this project is Parimala Thulasiraman. We also thank Parimala Thulasiraman's graduate student, Ying Ying Liu, for her contributions to this project.

This project is geared towards smart city applications with a specific focus on analysing the data collected from fibre optic acoustic sensing technologies.

Abstract: Consider a distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system monitoring a fibre optic cable deployed along an active roadway. The goal of this project is to use data collected from the DAS system to develop a detection and tracking method capable of identifying individual vehicles and reporting their position and velocity as they move along the road/fibre.  Once the position and velocity are determined, various metrics for traffic flow could be determined, allowing for prediction and optimization of traffic congestion.
