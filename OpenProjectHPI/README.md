As part of the PIMS Math^Industry Workshop, we analysed Housing Price Index Data from the Government
of Canada https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/7f497684-c857-4184-842c-6bc021f380f8, measured various 
metrics associated with the data including the mean and the standard deviation of the Housing Price Indices
in the data set, and used graphing tools to plot the data in several ways. The data that we analysed from the 
registry was in a CSV file format. The main file for our Housing Price Index analysis is 
Housing_Price_Index_PythonProject.ipynb.

The contributors to this analysis are Emily Korfanty, Jaeun Park, Jane Zhang, Sarah Nataj, Boya Peng,
and Brian Chan. We also thank Drs Ian Allison and James Colliander for their advices and helpful insights 
during the project.
